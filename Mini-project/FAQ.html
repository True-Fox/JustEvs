                An electric vehicle (EV) is a mode of transport which is powered by electricity. 
                Unlike conventional vehicles that use a gasoline (petrol) or diesel-powered engine, 
                electric cars and trucks use an electric motor powered by electricity from batteries 
                or a fuel cell. A key advantage of EVs over other forms of transport is that they hold 
                the potential to significantly reduce pollution by having zero exhaust emissions.

            There are three types of Electric Vehicles available: <br/>
            i) BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) which are 100% powered by electricity. <br/>
            ii) PHEVs (Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles) which are cars with an internal combustion engine and a battery charged from an external socket;
                in other words, they have a plug. <br/>
            iii) Hybrid cars are cars with an electric battery that is charged using the internal combustion engine (they don't have a plug).

            Electric motors are simply more efficient than combustion engines, 
            so more of the energy put in the battery ends up being used to drive the car. 
            Especially when driving in cities, electric vehicles waste less energy. 
            Also, there are simply no tailpipe emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particles.
